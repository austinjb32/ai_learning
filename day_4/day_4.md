# 🧠 Real-Time Sensor Fault Detection using Isolation Forest

## 🔍 Overview
This project simulates a live sensor feed using NASA bearing data and applies an AI model to detect anomalies in real-time.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- Streamlit (for dashboard)
- Isolation Forest (anomaly detection)
- NASA IMS Bearing Dataset

## 🎯 Purpose
To demonstrate the application of unsupervised learning in smart logistics systems for predictive maintenance.

## 📊 Demo Features
- Live data stream
- Sensor visualization
- Real-time fault alert
- Auto-generated logs

## 🔗 Dataset
[NASA Bearing Dataset](https://data.nasa.gov/download/ff5v-kuh6/application%2Fzip)

## 👨‍🔬 Outcome
This AI system can be adapted to logistic hubs, factories, and IoT systems to prevent machine failures through early detection.
